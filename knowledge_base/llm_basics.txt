Large Language Models (LLMs): Core Concepts

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of AI model trained on vast amounts of text data 
to understand and generate human language. LLMs use the Transformer architecture, introduced 
in the "Attention Is All You Need" paper by Vaswani et al. in 2017.

Key characteristics of LLMs:
1. Scale: Trained on billions or trillions of tokens
2. Emergent capabilities: Abilities that appear at sufficient scale
3. Few-shot learning: Can learn new tasks from just a few examples
4. In-context learning: Uses examples in the prompt

Popular LLMs include:
- GPT-4 by OpenAI (closed source)
- Claude by Anthropic (closed source)
- LLaMA 3 by Meta (open source)
- Gemini by Google (closed source)
- Mixtral by Mistral AI (open weights)

Training process involves:
1. Pre-training on large text corpora
2. Fine-tuning with supervised learning
3. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)
