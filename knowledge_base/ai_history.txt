Artificial Intelligence: A Brief History

The field of artificial intelligence (AI) was founded at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956. 
Researchers John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, and Nathaniel Rochester organized 
the first AI conference, coining the term "artificial intelligence."

Early AI systems used rule-based approaches and symbolic logic. The first AI programs 
included the Logic Theorist (1956) and General Problem Solver (1957) by Allen Newell and 
Herbert Simon.

The AI winter of the 1970s-1980s saw reduced funding and interest due to overpromised results.
However, the field revived with expert systems in the 1980s, machine learning in the 1990s,
and deep learning revolution starting in 2012.

Modern AI milestones include:
- 1997: Deep Blue defeats chess champion Garry Kasparov
- 2011: IBM Watson wins Jeopardy!
- 2012: AlexNet wins ImageNet competition, launching deep learning era
- 2017: Attention Is All You Need paper introduces the Transformer architecture
- 2022: ChatGPT launches, making LLMs mainstream
- 2023: GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini compete as frontier AI models
