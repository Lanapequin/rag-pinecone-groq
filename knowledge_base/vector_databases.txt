Vector Databases: Complete Guide

A vector database is a specialized database designed to store, index, and query 
high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) efficiently. Unlike traditional databases 
that search for exact matches, vector databases perform similarity search.

How vector search works:
1. Data (text, images) is converted to embeddings using an embedding model
2. Embeddings are stored in the vector database
3. At query time, the query is also converted to an embedding
4. The database finds stored vectors most similar to the query vector
5. Similarity is measured using cosine similarity, dot product, or Euclidean distance
